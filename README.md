2. **Connect Four**: A two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid, aiming to connect four of their discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
3. **Snake Game**: A game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food, while avoiding collisions with the ghost.
